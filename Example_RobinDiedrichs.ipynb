    "I need to dive deeper into neutron star properties for my coming projects and therefore need to especially review the above mentioned branches. The mentioned topics will espcially be important when studying the effect of WIMP DM on NS. The hope is to find new constraints on DM properties by using data from observed gravitaitional wave (GW) events. "

    "\n",
    "If we assume that the DM is thermalized within a neutron star (NS) core and if the average seperation between DM particles is larger than their de Broglie wavelength, then we can use a Boltzmann distribution to model their density. Assuming the NS core to have a homogeneous density $\\rho_\\text{NS}$ and core extent $a$, then the gravitational potential inside the core is $\\phi(r) = -2\\pi G \\rho_\\text{NS} (a^2 - r^2/3)$. At temperature $T$ and $r < a$ we therefore have for the DM density distribution\n",

    "    r_\\text{rms}^2 \\equiv \\frac{4\\pi \\int_0^\\infty r^4 \\rho(r) dr}{4 \\pi \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\rho(r) dr} = \\frac{9 k_B T}{4 \\pi G \\rho_\\text{NS}\\, m_\\text{DM}}.\n",

    "__r-mode oscillations__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read [2] and [3], where r-modes are invesigated in combination with DM. Interestingly, a bit of DM can increase viscosity in NS and therefore balances the r-mode instability at higher rotation frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you consider a star made up of only fermionic DM [3], then they have a relatively small shear viscosity, meaning that the r-mode instability will reduce the rotation frequency efficiently down to about 20\\% of the Keplerian limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in general we have that strongly coupled fields exhibit low viscosity, while weakly coupled fields have higher viscosity. While this might be unintuitiv at first glance, it kind of makes sense since weak coupling means longer mean free paths and thus changes at a position A can propagate faster to position B. (Note that this is just the typical behavior, which must not be true in all cases. See chapter 4.1 in [3].)"

    "__DM cores in NS__:\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the \"thermal radius\" $r_\\text{rms}$ using the above formula for typical values of NS cores, such as $\\rho_\\text{NS} \\approx 10^{15}\\,\\text{g/cm}^3$, $T \\approx 10^6\\,\\text{K}$ and $m_\\text{DM} \\approx 100\\,\\text{GeV}$, we get $r_\\text{rms} \\approx \\mathcal{O}(10)\\,\\text{cm}$. The extent of the DM core is therefore relatively small compared to the extent of the NS core $\\approx \\mathcal{O}(10)\\,\\text{km}$. If we are interested in the GW that are produced by NS merger events, then this justifies to treat the DM distribution as point masses during most of the process! This significantly simplifies calculations for the inspiral and merger. I expect that this approximation breaks down during the post-merger though.\n",
    "\n",
    "My equation for the thermal radius is off by a factor of 2 compared to the one given in [1]. While this does not qualitatively change any of the above statements, I should still identify where this deviation comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "__r-mode oscillations__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since weak couplings between DM and the NS constituents can have a significant impact on the r-mode stability, it might be possible to infer constraints on DM by using the measured distribution of NS spin frequencies. Note that this is especially relevant for WIMP DM as it falls in the relevant coupling and mass range [2]."
